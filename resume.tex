Job Market Paper (\href{https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/sites/liberalarts.tulane.edu/files/sites/default/files/Xie%20JMP_0.pdf}{Link to paper})
\begin{itemize}
  \item Target: Conduct causal inference/policy evaluations on how dividend tax policies affected firms and financial market in China 
  \item Methods: Event Study model; Difference-in-Differences model; Matching Methods (One-to-One Matching, k-Nearest-Neighbor Matching, Radius Matching, Kernel Matching, Local Linear Matching, and Mahalanobis Distance Matching)
  \item Outcomes: Supported by Tulane SLA Dissertation Fellowship and Laura Bassi Scholarship; Research results were presented in field top conferences including National Tax Association/Chinese Economists Society annual meeting
  %\item Utilize an event study model based on previous literature to prove firms’ behaviors after each policy change were tax-driven; Use a difference-in-differences model to examine the impact of the 2005 and 2012 policy changes on stocks’ turnover rates and trading volumes;
  %\item Implement a variety of matching methods (One-to-One Matching, k-Nearest-Neighbor Matching, Radius Matching, Kernel Matching, Local Linear Matching, and Mahalanobis Distance Matching) to reconstruct control and treatment groups to improve the accuracy of estimation;
  %\item Supported by Tulane SLA Dissertation Fellowship and Laura Bassi Scholarship; Presented at 2019 Chinese Economists Society North America Conference, Lawrence, KS; and 2018 National Tax Association Annual Meeting, New Orleans, LA;

With Daniela Rivero Bryant, Lu Yao
\begin{itemize}
  \item Target: Analyze the relationships between self-reported adolescent health and two key economic outcomes: educational attainment and employment status during early adulthood
  \item Methods: Use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLYS97); Test the hypothesis with using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Logit model and Hazard model (survival analysis)
