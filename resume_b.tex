%\href{https://liberalarts.tulane.edu/sites/liberalarts.tulane.edu/files/sites/default/files/Xie%20JMP_0.pdf}{Link to paper}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Target: Conduct causal inference/policy evaluations on how dividend tax policies affected firms and financial market in China by using over 20,000 firms' data from Chinese stock market 
  \item Methods: Event Study model; Difference-in-Differences model; Matching Methods (One-to-One Matching, k-Nearest-Neighbor Matching, Radius Matching, Kernel Matching, Local Linear Matching, and Mahalanobis Distance Matching)
  \item Outcomes: Supported by Tulane SLA Dissertation Fellowship and Laura Bassi Scholarship; Research results were presented in field top conferences including National Tax Association/Chinese Economists Society annual meeting
  %\item Presented at 2018 National Tax Association/2019 Chinese Economists Society annual meeting
  %\item Utilize an event study model based on previous literature to prove firms’ behaviors after each policy change were tax-driven; Use a difference-in-differences model to examine the impact of the 2005 and 2012 policy changes on stocks’ turnover rates and trading volumes;
  %\item Implement a variety of matching methods (One-to-One Matching, k-Nearest-Neighbor Matching, Radius Matching, Kernel Matching, Local Linear Matching, and Mahalanobis Distance Matching) to reconstruct control and treatment groups to improve the accuracy of estimation;

With Daniela Rivero Bryant, Lu Yao
\begin{itemize}
  \item Target: Analyze the relationships between self-reported adolescent health and two key economic outcomes: educational attainment and employment status during early adulthood
  \item Methods: Use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLYS97); Test the hypothesis with using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Logit model and Hazard model (survival analysis) 
  %\item Test the hypothsis with using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Logit model and Hazard model (survical analysis);
  %\item Outcomes: We find that people who reported better health tend to accumulate more years of education
  \end{itemize}

%With Daniela Rivero Bryant, Lu Yao
%\begin{itemize}
  %\item Target: This project aims to predict the probability of default (PD) based on historical data on 250,000 borrowers with features including income, debt ratio, number of dependents, real estate loan status, etc. 
  %\item Methods: Methods: PD analysis gives the likelihood of a default given certain period; Use python to clean data, build baseline logit model, stepwise feature selection and cross-validate models
  %\item Test the hypothsis with using Ordinary Least Square (OLS), Logit model and Hazard model (survical analysis);
  %\item Outcomes: We find that people who reported better health tend to accumulate more years of education
  %\end{itemize}
